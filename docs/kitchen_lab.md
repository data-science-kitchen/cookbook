# Kitchen Lab

At the heart of Data Science Kitchen lies our Kitchen Lab, a creative hub where ideas take shape, projects come to life, and knowledge is shared. 

## Project Categories

We organize projects into three main categories, each with its own focus and approach. No matter which type you choose, all projects at Data Science Kitchen are designed to foster learning, collaboration, and community growth.

1. **Educational Projects**: Educational projects are all about growing together as a team. These projects are a chance for everyone involved to learn and sharpen their Data Science skills. Whether you’re diving into a Kaggle competition, participating in a hackathon, or creating learning content, these projects provide hands-on experience with a clear educational focus. Typically, they are shorter in duration, involve small teams, and have defined timelines.

2. **Practical Projects**: Practical projects aim to solve real-world problems using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. While they may offer educational experiences, the primary goal is to develop a working solution. Examples include building applications or dashboards, performing data analysis, or creating datasets to address specific challenges. The scope and duration of these projects vary, depending on the complexity of the task, and team sizes can adjust accordingly.

3. **Research Projects**: Research projects are focused on exploring new ideas and advancing the field of Data Science. These projects operate like a traditional research lab, with the goal of producing publishable research papers. Unlike academic institutions, however, we rely on the voluntary participation of team members to drive progress. Research projects provide the opportunity to contribute to the cutting edge of Data Science, with the potential for publication in peer-reviewed journals or conferences.

## How Our Projects Work

Regardless of the type of project, every team must appoint at least one project lead, who will serve as the main point of contact. Beyond this, teams are free to organize themselves, manage their time, and determine how they will work together. The only requirement is that all project outcomes must be openly shared once the project is completed. This could mean releasing code and documentation as open source, publishing papers on arXiv, or sharing results with the community through a Kitchen Talks presentation.

Ready to start a project? Here’s how:

1. **Find an Idea**: Think about what you want to achieve and decide which project category it fits into. Check our [#ideas](https://discord.com/channels/1266840090987200708/1266847603534856203) channel on Discord or the kitchen-lab repository on GitHub to see if similar projects are already in progress.

2. **Research Existing Work**: If you're starting a practical or research project, take a moment to review prior work in the field. Engaging with the community on Discord or GitHub can help refine your idea and ensure you’re building on what’s already been done.

3. **Find Your Team**: Use the [#looking-for-a-team](https://discord.com/channels/1266840090987200708/1269023783650463774) channel on Discord or directly connect with community members to gather collaborators.

4. **Organize and Lead**: Once your team is formed, decide how you want to work and appoint at least one project lead. Then, register your project in our project portfolio on GitHub using the provided issue template.

5. **Collaborate and Grow**: Start working on your project. For longer-term efforts, consider presenting your progress at Kitchen Talks to get feedback and support from the community.

6. **Share Your Success**: When the project is complete, share the results on GitHub, document your findings, and present what you’ve learned in a Kitchen Talks session. Remember, our focus is on learning and growing together – sometimes, the outcome of a project might look different from the initial plan, and that’s perfectly okay.
