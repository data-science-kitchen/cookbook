# Kitchen Talks

Kitchen Talks is a bi-weekly gathering where curiosity and learning take center stage. Designed for anyone passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, or related fields, this informal event offers a unique space to explore and discuss topics that spark your interest.

Each Kitchen Talk revolves around a specific topic within these fields. Presentations might dive into a groundbreaking scientific paper, showcase a powerful machine learning library, offer a tutorial, or introduce a fascinating new concept. The goal is simple: to create a shared learning experience where everyone can grow together.

Our 60-minute sessions are led by a host who will begin with a brief 5-10 minute introduction to the topic and the presenter. This is followed by a 25-30 minute presentation, after which participants are encouraged to engage in discussions and share their thoughts. Throughout the presentation, you can also submit your questions in the chat.

Depending on the presenter's preference, the session will be conducted in either English or German. While the introduction and presentation are recorded and made publicly available, the post-presentation discussion remains private to foster a safe and open dialogue.

If you’re passionate about a topic and would like to present, or if you’re interested in hosting an upcoming session, we’d love to hear from you! Please take look at our [Kitchen Talks repository](https://github.com/data-science-kitchen/kitchen-talks) to add proposals for new topics.
