# Getting Started

## What is DSK?

Data Science Kitchen (DSK) is a non-profit community on a mission to make data science, machine learning, and AI technologies accessible, useful, and understandable for everyone. We advocate for a science-based, realistic adoption of these technologies across all areas of society, helping to cut through the hype and provide clear, fact-based education about what data science can truly achieve.

One of our key goals is to support people interested in exploring data science, offering opportunities to dive into the field and learn from experts. Whether you're just getting started or are already experienced, DSK is a place where knowledge is shared openly, and everyone can grow together.

We are also passionate about offering a balanced perspective by setting realistic expectations about these technologies. Media is full of exaggerated claims and overblown promises about AI. It is our mission to contrast and ground such claims with transparent and evidence-based assessments and curated information.

Because we believe that an informed opinion can only be build on a foundation of understanding, DSK offers regular [Kitchen Talks](kitchen_talks.md), where experts from academia and industry present and discuss topics from practical applications to cutting-edge research. Unique to our approach is the focus on exploring a specific topic in-depth over multiple sessions.

We also offer [Kitchen Lab](kitchen_lab.md), a platform for pitching project ideas and collaborating with fellow community members. These projects can be research-oriented, application-driven, or focused on learning. Our public Discord server is another key part of our community, where we discuss current developments, share knowledge, and coordinate events and projects.

At DSK, we believe that data science has the power to shape a better future. We are committed to making sure this is done in a way that benefits everyone, through collaboration, transparency, and a focus on real, science-based outcomes. Our motto: *No Bullshit – Just Data Science*.
