Even when frustrated, we must avoid personal attacks. A community where people feel unsafe or threatened is not productive. Members should treat each other, and those outside the community, with respect.</li> <li>Address Mistakes Constructively: We acknowledge our mistakes and approach others' errors with respect. Solving problems together is part of our community ethos. It\u2019s up to us to seek help when needed and offer it when asked.</li> <li>Communicate Openly: Whenever possible, we opt for public channels over private messages to allow others to learn from and join in the conversation. Explain your methods and actions in clear, simple terms, and strive to make data science accessible to everyone.</li> <li>Prioritize Simplicity and Sustainability: Choose solutions that are understandable, maintainable, and sustainable. Aim for simplicity\u2014strive for the best solution, not the most complicated one.</li> <li>Learn with Humility: No one knows everything.

We advocate for a science-based, realistic adoption of these technologies across all areas of society, helping to cut through the hype and provide clear, fact-based education about what data science can truly achieve.</p> <p>One of our key goals is to support people interested in exploring data science, offering opportunities to dive into the field and learn from experts. Whether you're just getting started or are already experienced, DSK is a place where knowledge is shared openly, and everyone can grow together.</p> <p>We are also passionate about offering a balanced perspective by setting realistic expectations about these technologies. Media is full of exaggerated claims and overblown promises about AI. It is our mission to contrast and ground such claims with transparent and evidence-based assessments and curated information.</p> <p>Because we believe that an informed opinion can only be build on a foundation of understanding, DSK offers regular Kitchen Talks, where experts from academia and industry present and discuss topics from practical applications to cutting-edge research. Unique to our approach is the focus on exploring a specific topic in-depth over multiple sessions.</p> <p>We also offer Kitchen Lab, a platform for pitching project ideas and collaborating with fellow community members. These projects can be research-oriented, application-driven, or focused on learning. Our public Discord server is another key part of our community, where we discuss current developments, share knowledge, and coordinate events and projects.</p> <p>At DSK, we believe that data science has the power to shape a better future. We are committed to making sure this is done in a way that benefits everyone, through collaboration, transparency, and a focus on real, science-based outcomes.

No matter which type you choose, all projects at Data Science Kitchen are designed to foster learning, collaboration, and community growth.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Educational Projects: Educational projects are all about growing together as a team. These projects are a chance for everyone involved to learn and sharpen their Data Science skills. Whether you\u2019re diving into a Kaggle competition, participating in a hackathon, or creating learning content, these projects provide hands-on experience with a clear educational focus. Typically, they are shorter in duration, involve small teams, and have defined timelines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Practical Projects: Practical projects aim to solve real-world problems using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. While they may offer educational experiences, the primary goal is to develop a working solution. Examples include building applications or dashboards, performing data analysis, or creating datasets to address specific challenges. The scope and duration of these projects vary, depending on the complexity of the task, and team sizes can adjust accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Research Projects: Research projects are focused on exploring new ideas and advancing the field of Data Science. These projects operate like a traditional research lab, with the goal of producing publishable research papers. Unlike academic institutions, however, we rely on the voluntary participation of team members to drive progress. Research projects provide the opportunity to contribute to the cutting edge of Data Science, with the potential for publication in peer-reviewed journals or conferences.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"kitchen_lab/#how-our-projects-work","title":"How Our Projects Work","text":"<p>Regardless of the type of project, every team must appoint at least one project lead, who will serve as the main point of contact. Beyond this, teams are free to organize themselves, manage their time, and determine how they will work together. The only requirement is that all project outcomes must be openly shared once the project is completed. This could mean releasing code and documentation as open source, publishing papers on arXiv, or sharing results with the community through a Kitchen Talks presentation.</p> <p>Ready to start a project? Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Find an Idea: Think about what you want to achieve and decide which project category it fits into. Check our #ideas channel on Discord or the kitchen-lab repository on GitHub to see if similar projects are already in progress.</p> </li> <li> <p>Research Existing Work: If you're starting a practical or research project, take a moment to review prior work in the field. Engaging with the community on Discord or GitHub can help refine your idea and ensure you\u2019re building on what\u2019s already been done.</p> </li> <li> <p>Find Your Team: Use the #looking-for-a-team channel on Discord or directly connect with community members to gather collaborators.</p> </li> <li> <p>Organize and Lead: Once your team is formed, decide how you want to work and appoint at least one project lead. Then, register your project in our project portfolio on GitHub using the provided issue template.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collaborate and Grow: Start working on your project. For longer-term efforts, consider presenting your progress at Kitchen Talks to get feedback and support from the community.</p> </li> <li> <p>Share Your Success: When the project is complete, share the results on GitHub, document your findings, and present what you\u2019ve learned in a Kitchen Talks session. Remember, our focus is on learning and growing together \u2013 sometimes, the outcome of a project might look different from the initial plan, and that\u2019s perfectly okay.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"kitchen_talks/","title":"Kitchen Talks","text":"<p>Kitchen Talks is a bi-weekly gathering where curiosity and learning take center stage.
